# Glow_Discharge_using_DG-FEM
This is a DG-FEM solver that solves for the steady state of an electric glow discharge. The main novelty in this work is the implementation of a positivity preserving flux scheme that ensures that there are no negative number densities predicted, which makes this a high-order and physically accurate solver.
