# Glow_Discharge_using_DG-FEM
This is a DG-FEM solver that solves for the steady state of an electric glow discharge. The main novelty in this work is the implementation of a positivity preserving flux scheme that ensures that there are no negative number densities predicted, which makes this a high-order and physically accurate solver.
The code in this repository was the first version that was succesful in generating correct results. Further changes were made to the code including making the code stylistically correct and adding comments explaining each variable and function's use/role. BUut those versions cannot be released due to restrictions in reasing the code to the publc (These restrictions come from the funding source).
