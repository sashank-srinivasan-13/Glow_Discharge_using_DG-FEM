Iteration : 0 , t = 0, Timestep in use = 1e-12, Potential drop = 1000, solve time : 0s per iteration
Iteration : 500000 , t = 2.5e-07, Timestep in use = 1e-12, Potential drop = 999.973, solve time : 0.000658162s per iteration
DANGER: Timestep is smaller than lowest limit required at time t = 4.66944e-07
